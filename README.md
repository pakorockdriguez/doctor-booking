## 🧪 Known Limitations

❌ No Data Persistence: Bookings and availability reset on page reload. Could be improved with localStorage, a backend, or a database.

🔒 No Authentication: Users can book appointments without logging in or any access control.

🧠 No Input Validation: Form validations can be added for a more robust experience.

📅 No Calendar View: Replacing time slot buttons with a calendar/time picker would improve UX.

🌐 No API Integration: Currently using mock data; future enhancements may include real-time API/backend support.
